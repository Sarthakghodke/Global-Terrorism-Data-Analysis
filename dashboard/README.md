## 📊 Power BI Dashboard – Global Terrorism Analysis

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to analyze global terrorism trends
from 1970 to 2021 using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD).

### Dashboard Features
- Year-wise trend of terrorist incidents
- Region-wise and country-wise attack distribution
- Attack types and weapon categories
- Casualties analysis (killed & wounded)

### Note on Power BI File
The original Power BI (.pbix) file is not uploaded to this repository due to
GitHub file size limitations.

Instead, dashboard screenshots are provided in the `images/` folder to
demonstrate the insights and visualizations.

### Key Insights
- Terrorist activity peaked between 2012–2015 before declining
- Majority of attacks were domestic in nature
- Explosives were the most commonly used weapon type
- A small number of regions accounted for a large share of total incidents


### Tools Used

- Python (for data preprocessing)
- Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
