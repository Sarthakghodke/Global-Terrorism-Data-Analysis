## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD):

Source: https://www.start.umd.edu/data-tools/GTD

Due to GitHub file size limitations (25 MB), the full dataset
(1970–2021, ~196 MB) is not uploaded to this repository.

Instead, a representative sampled dataset (~22 MB) is provided in:
data/raw/globalterrorismdb_reduced_sample.csv

The full dataset was:
- Divided into two parts (1970–2016 and 2016–2021)
- Merged into a single dataset
- Cleaned by removing missing values, inconsistencies, and errors
- Processed for analysis and visualization
